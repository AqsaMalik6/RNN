# RNN
 Hey! 🤖 RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are a type of neural network designed for sequential data like text or time series. They have loops to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs, making them great for tasks like language modeling and speech recognition. 🧠 They can use their internal state to process variable-length sequences. 📈🔁
